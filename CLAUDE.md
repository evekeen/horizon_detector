## Project
The idea is for a dataset of many photos and their respective horizon Y coordinate and camera roll angle to design a lightweight model and train it to infer these horizon level and the roll angle.
The model ideally should be able to run on a mobile device.
The model accuracy should be pretty high, and we have a pretty big dataset for that (around 7Gb of images).
